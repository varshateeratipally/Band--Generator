Band Name Generator
This application is a simple Band Name Generator built using Express.js. It serves as a fun tool for generating random band names by combining random adjectives and nouns. The application uses Node.js with Express for server-side handling and employs EJS as the templating engine to dynamically render content. Upon accessing the root URL, users are presented with a welcome message and a button to generate a band name. When the user submits the form, the application randomly selects an adjective and a noun from predefined arrays and displays them as a unique band name.

To get started, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. Install the necessary dependencies using npm install, and then start the server by running node index.js. You can access the application by navigating to http://localhost:3060 in your browser. The project structure includes the main server file, index.js, and EJS templates located in the views directory. Static files such as stylesheets are served from the public directory. This application utilizes body-parser middleware to parse incoming request bodies and express-static middleware to serve static files. The project is a fun and creative way to experiment with Express.js and EJS for dynamic content rendering.
